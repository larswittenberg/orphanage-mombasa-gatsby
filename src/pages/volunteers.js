					<h3>Be a part</h3>
					<p>Anyone who is interested in getting to know the Kenyan culture should
						consider spending time volunteering at an orphanage. Volunteers are warmly
						welcomed to Child of Mercy Orphanage Centre at any time all year round. You have
						the opportunity to become a part of the day-to-day routine and get to know what
						life is about for Kenyan people.</p>
					<h3>Where we are</h3>
					<p className="sb-small">Child of Mercy Orphanage Centre is situated close to Shelly
						Beach and a five minute walk from the Likoni slum area south of Mombasa across
						the Likoni Ferry. It is 10 minutes from Timbwani Nursery and Primary School and
						about half an hour to the large supermarket back across the ferry in Mombasa.
						The house is set within a half-acre walled plot with poultry area, veg plot and
						space to play games with the children.</p>

					<h3>Accommondation for volunteers</h3>
					<p>By staying in the same house with the children, volunteers are completely
						integrated in their lives. As a volunteer you will stay upstairs on the first
						floor, so you have your own area with separated rooms, shower, flush-toilet,
						lounge area with balcony and kitchenette with hob and fridge. All meals are
						provided but you can also self-cater upstairs if you like.</p>
					<h3>A day in a volunteer´s life</h3>
					<p>It is difficult to describe a typical day for a volunteers because everything
						depends on our own interests, your capabilities and your abilities. The most
						important role is to give the children love, attention and care.
					</p>
					<h3>Activities and duties</h3>
					<p>As a volunteer you could help us take care of the children during their free
						time, helping them with their homework and playing games with them. Your work
						may also include preparing food for the children, general cleaning and washing
						or even helping in the Primary and Nursery Schools.
					</p>
					<p>We are very happy if you are willing to organize games and activities for the
						children, drawing and painting or reading to them. On Sundays you could also
						join them going to church or take them to the beach and go swimming.
					</p>
					<p>If you are interested you may also create your own activities with the
						children. Any ideas are welcomed and you may have specific skills that you can
						offer.
					</p>

				<div className="col-md-6">
					<h3>Freetime activities</h3>
					<p className="sb-small">During your free time you also have the opportunity to go on
						safari for one to three nights with pickup at the house, to go on trips to
						explore Kenya, to meet local families and visit their homes as well as other
						local schools. If there are any particular activities that you would like to
						try, let us know and we will do our best to organize it for you.

							<span className="first-letter">H</span>abari, we were staying at the Child of Mercy
							Orphanage for 3 months (June-August 2013). It is a really well organized
							orphanage with lovely accommodations for volunteers.</p>
						<p>We enjoyed teaching the children at school or kindergarten, helping them with
							their homework or just being around with them. While their free time we took
							them to the beach, did some game competitions or arranged trips with them, for
							example Haller Park, football match, cinema etc...</p>
						<p>During our 3 months stay we got really close to the children and took them to
							our hearts. Also “Mama” Jessica and the rest of the staff is so kind and made us
							feel at home. It was a wonderful time and a great experience to be part of such
							a BIG family with a different culture in a foreign country.
						</p>
						<p>We didn’t only learn something about the Kenyan life “pole pole” and the
							culture, we also had the opportunity to explore and fell in love with the
							beautiful Kenya. We already miss the children, Jessica and the rest of the staff
							and are looking forward to see them again very soon. If you also want to make
							such great experiences, take your chance and be a volunteer at the COMOC.
						</p>
						<p>Every day is worth it!</p>

							<span className="first-letter">S</span>everal years of our lifetime passed by
							learning law of calculations, german literature of the 18th century, etc. So we
							decided to get away from uninspired theoretical schooling to continue with
							learning by experiencing, travelling and facing real life.
						</p>
						<p>Freshly graduated from school and before starting our studies at university
							we left to stay two months in Kenya volunteering. Finally we arrived at the
							beautiful place “Child of Mercy”! We got to know COMOC as a lovely and caring
							home for children with friendly and open-hearted staff. Beginning from the first
							moment we were welcomed warmly and felt at home. Passing more and more time at
							COMOC our relationship with the children became closer and familiar. Moreover
							volunteering is the best way to get to know a country with its people. During
							our stay we became acquainted with the Kenyan culture and the locals while
							living an authentic everyday life. Aside from our days in the project we went on
							various journeys to explore Kenyas fascinating places and diversity. We didn’t
							only take the COMOC children to our hearts but also some of the other volunteers
							we spent a long time with, we formed a familiar friendship.
						</p>
						<p>Concluding our two months in Africa it is to be said that this journey was an
							unforgettable lifetime experience that we recommend warmly to everyone. Over and
							above we noticed a positive personal change, felt like a part of COMOC and are
							going to miss Kenya and especially the lovely children.

							<span className="first-letter">S</span>ince I was a child I have been interested in
							other cultures. That is the reason why I love to travel all over the world. But
							then I felt I have to stay somewhere for longer than two to six weeks to become
							part of the day-to-day routine in order to get to know other cultures and ways
							of life.
						</p>
						<p>So I heard about volunteering at orphanages in Kenya, especially of Child of
							Mercy in Likoni and decided to experience such an adventure. I was really
							excited when I got there because of never have been worked with children or not
							knowing any details about the accommodation or what a day looks like.
						</p>
						<p>It only took me a few days to get to know everyone and the day-to-day
							routine, so that I could take a part of the people’s lives. Jessy as well as all
							the other workers at Comoc tried to make me feel at home and they are very
							friendly and open-hearted. I really enjoyed playing with the children and
							supporting them.
						</p>
						<p>Life is so different in Africa but because of everybody being so kind and
							frank I indeed felt like being home. Comoc has such a special vibe that I will
							never forget. So it shaped out as the best experience in life and I can warmly
							recommended it to everyone who is interested in other cultures and wants to know
							what life is about for people in Kenya, especially for children in an orphanage
							centre.</p>

								formed in 2010 and is situated within a half-acre walled plot close to Shelly
								Beach, and a five minute walk from the Likoni slum area south of Mombasa. It is
								home to 23 children â€“ both boys and girls from ages 5-15 years. Before getting
								here the children had lives without any prospects: They are orphans without a
								family, neglected and abandoned children who lived on the street or from poor
								families who could not afford to take care of the children.</p>
						</div>
						<div className="col-md-6">
							<p>Jessy, the Director of the Orphanage Centre, as well as all the workers at
								COMOC, offer a home to the children where they can act like a child and also be
								prepared for their adult life. The children get all necessities like food,
								clothes, medicine, education, aspirations for life and most importantly love and
								support. Jessy indeed became a mom for 23 children.</p>
							<p>But to offer the children such a life, they are completely reliant on
								donations of well-wishing people.</p>
